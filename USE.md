# How to use

## Downloading

First of all, download the library in release page (could be a SNAPSHOT version).

## Plugging in maven

You need to define the scope in system and put in the systemPath the library path, example bellow.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.gameszaum.core</groupId>
            <artifactId>games-core</artifactId>
            <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>system</scope>
            <systemPath>C:/APIs/games-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</systemPath>
        </dependency>
        
## Methods 

 I will upload a video in Youtube and create a java-docs to explain some games-core methods, but you can try reading the code and
 making your own methods/updates. :)
